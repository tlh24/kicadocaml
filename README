OVERVIEW: 

Kicadocaml is a PCB layout tool that reads and writes Kicad's pcbnew *.brd
files. It is unique in that it reads in BOTH the schematic and board, so you 
can select and filter components & associated tracks based on schematic
hierarchy.  Furthermore, it allows you to array duplicated sub-sheets of the 
schematic, thereby saving time.  

It was/is written by Tim Hanson, sideskate@gmail.com

NETLIST & STARTING A NEW BOARD:

Currently kicadocaml does not do netlist import, nor can it read kicad's footprint
libraries; hence, to start a board, *you must use pcbnew*.  also, if you update
the netlist, you must also use pcbnew.  sorry. Write me an email to complain 
and maybe I'll fix it ;-)

ISSUES:

Kicadocaml requires OpenGL - e.g. an Nvidia video card (they seem to 
work better than ATI products with Linux).  It works on my laptop, which has 
an Intel 945GM graphics accelerator, but not nearly as awesomely as on my desktop
(Nvidia 8800 GTX). 

Note: pcbnew does not always save the net # in the tracks - therefore, when 
opening a board that was previously saved in pcbnew yuo may want to 
"Propagate netcodes to all tracks" (in the options menu) if kicadocaml
does not automatically realize that it was prev. saved in pcbnew. 

Kicadocaml features a novel triangle-based zone filling algorithm; if
zone fill fails in pcbnew, you can fill it in kicadocaml.  However, you cannot 
set the zone edges in the program - more missing features! 

Preference support is severly lacking; kicadocaml should remember the 
state of all options, as well as the grid resolution.

Most all dimensions and measurements are in inches, with some display/
entry support for milimeters. 

BUILDING:

To build from source, install (with apt-get or another manager):
# apt-get install ocaml liblablgl-ocaml-dev libpcre-ocaml-dev ocaml-findlib

The liblablgl package in Debian Etch is broken, unfortunately, 
so you must rebuild it from source.  To do this, run
# apt-get -b source liblablgl-ocaml-dev
in some directory, (and install any required dependencies) and then 
# dpkg -i liblablgl-ocaml_1.02-2_i386.deb
# dpkg -i liblablgl-ocaml-dev_1.02-2_i386.deb

Then you can run 
$ make opt
(or just 'make' if you want the bytecode executable)
and everything should work!
Once you have started the program, be sure to look at 'about'
hidden (for now) in the 'options' menu for the keyboard commands.
